# Perceptron Classification From Scratch with Iris Data

This project implements the Perceptron algorithm from scratch in Python to perform binary classification with the Iris dataset. The Iris dataset is a well-known dataset in machine learning that consists of 150 samples of iris flowers, each with 4 features (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width) and a target label (the species of iris).
## Features

This project includes the following features:

    Implementation of Perceptron algorithm from scratch
    Binary classification of data using the Perceptron algorithm
    Evaluation of the classification performance using accuracy and confusion matrix

## Dataset

The Iris dataset used in this project is publicly available on the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The dataset consists of 150 samples of iris flowers with different attributes, such as sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. There are three target classes in the dataset: Iris Setosa, Iris Versicolour, and Iris Virginica.
## Requirements

This project requires Python 3.x and the following libraries:

    NumPy
    Matplotlib
    Scikit-learn
